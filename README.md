This is an android app where you can use two different calculators (EXACT same functionality, different background color!). One with an ModelViewPresenter design, and the other with a ModelViewViewModel design.

We start by creating the main activity layout which will have a nav host fragment hosting our multi-fragmented app. We create the main activity class.

Our three fragment views use viewbinding instead of findbyid.
